## Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. Hydration Error Management

Encountered hydration mismatch errors caused by browser extensions injecting attributes into the HTML body.

**Solution:**

- Used `suppressHydrationWarning` in the root layout
- Ensured client-side components render only after initial mount using React hooks

---

### 2. Custom Animation Without Heavy Libraries

Needed smooth animations without increasing bundle size.

**Solution:**

- Built FAQ accordion animations using pure Tailwind CSS
- Used CSS Grid logic for smooth "slide-down" effects
- Avoided external animation libraries to keep performance optimized

---

### 3. Swiper Continuous Loop Fix

Faced an issue where the slider showed a blank gap before looping.

**Solution:**

- Implemented a data-doubling strategy
- Configured Swiper for seamless infinite scrolling
- Ensured smooth looping even with limited slides
